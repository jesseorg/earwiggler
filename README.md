# earwiggler
This is some of the code for earwigger2022. It is ported from xxMo 2017 bt LvTong.

This project can build in STM32Cube. It does not use HAL or LL, though Cube seems to insert those libraries.
It uses CMSIS to set the hardware configurations/'drivers'.

This transmits an id, about 2 meters. That is all.
